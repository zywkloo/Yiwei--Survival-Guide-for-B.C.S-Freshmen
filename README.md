# Survival Guide for B.C.S Freshmen
### A mini shooting and simulation game by Yiwei

The main character is spaceship driven by a robot, but actually this is kind of avatar or representative of a freshman in the B.C.S program. The main goal of the character is to survive until the time in the right-top corner runs out, with your CGPA of the four courses as high as possible. 

For sure you can also set your own goal as achieving an awful transcript in the end ;)
